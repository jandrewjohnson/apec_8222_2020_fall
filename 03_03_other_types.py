# Reminder, this assumes you have setup an envioronment with conda using:

print('list_1', list_1)

dictionary_1 = {23: "Favorite number", 24: "Second favorite number"}
print('dictionary_1', dictionary_1)

# Although it is not usually best, you can run specific lines by selecting them and using the shortcut Alt-Shift-E
# or right-click --> Run Selection.

# Here is a multi line string: (also discusses improved capabilities of an IDE editor)

ide_fun_tricks = """
1.) Move back and forth in your history of cursor positions (using your mouse forward and back buttons)
2.) Edit on multiple lines at the same time (hold alt and click new spots)
3.) Smartly paste DIFFERENT values
4.) Duplicate lines (ctrl-d)
5.) Introspection (e.g., jump between function definition and usages)
6.) Debugging (Interactively walk through your code one line at a time)
7.) Profiling your code (see which lines take the most time to compute.)
8.) Keep track of a history of copy-paste items and paste from past copies. (ctrl-shift-v)

## Functions

def my_function(input_parameter_1, input_parameter_2):
    product = input_parameter_1 * input_parameter_2
    return product


function_output = my_function(4, 5)

# print('function_output', function_output)

##Looping.

# Example here will calculate the average of every third integer between 100 and 136.
# The range() function is a python built-in that lets you iterate through a range of numbers.

small_range = range(0, 10)
print('small_range:', small_range)

small_range_as_list = list(range(0, 10))
# print('small_range_as_list:', small_range_as_list)

big_range = range(0, 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000) # This would be over 1 dodecatillion integegers, larger than the number of atoms in the galaxy.
print('big_range', big_range)

medium_range_as_list = list(range(0, 1000000))
# print('medium_range_as_list:', medium_range_as_list)

# DO NOT RUN THIS. YOUR COMPUTER WILL LITERALLY EXPLODE.
# big_range_as_list = list(range(0, 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000))
# print('big_range_as_list', big_range_as_list)


# Here is a for loop. Also note that python EXPLICITLY USES TAB-LEVEL to denote nested things.
# I.e., the inner part of the loop is tabbed 1 level up. Python does not use { like  R.
# I LOVE this notation and it's a big part of why python is so pretty and readable.
sum = 0 # Set the initial variable values
num = 0
for i in range(100, 136, 3):
    sum = sum + i
    num = num + 1

    for j in range(200, 300):
        sum = sum * 2

mean = sum / num
# print('mean', mean)

## Exercise 2:
"""Combine the function definition process with a loop to calculate the Sum of Squared Numbers
from 1 to 100
HINT, ** is the exponent operator in python.

BONUS: Make sure you're actually right by inserting a print statement in each step.
"""

## Exercise 3:
"""Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. 
For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for 
the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three 
and five print "FizzBuzz"."""
