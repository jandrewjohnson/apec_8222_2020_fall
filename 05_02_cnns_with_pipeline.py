# This activity compares different values for regularization parameter ‘alpha’.
# The plot shows that different alphas yield different decision functions.

# Recall that alpha is a parameter for regularization term, aka penalty term, that combats
# overfitting by constraining the size of the weights. Increasing alpha may fix
# high variance (a sign of overfitting) by encouraging smaller weights,
# resulting in a decision boundary plot that appears with lesser curvatures.
# Similarly, decreasing alpha may fix high bias (a sign of underfitting) by
# encouraging larger weights, potentially resulting in a more complicated decision boundary.

# Create a vector of alphas to test.
alphas = np.logspace(-5, 3, 5)

# Assign those alphas to some names.
# Notice also a very cool feature in python called "list comprehension":

# Instead of
# for i in alphas:
#   names.append(alpha ' + str(i))

# List comprehension defines the for loop INSIDE a list.
names = ['alpha ' + str(i) for i in alphas]

# print('names', names)

# Now for the heavy lifting
# We will create a Pipeline of transforms with a final estimator.

# Sequentially apply a list of transforms and a final estimator.
# Intermediate steps of the pipeline must be ‘transforms’, that is,
# they must implement fit and transform methods. The final estimator only
# needs to implement fit.

# The purpose of the pipeline is to assemble several steps that can be cross-validated
# together while setting different parameters.
